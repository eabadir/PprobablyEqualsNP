## TL;DR  
Lean 4 keeps the same dependent‑type theory as Lean 3, but the *surface* you program on is cleaner: one uniform language (no separate tactic DSL), a revamped macro engine, and a simpler, instance‑driven coercion system. The old “special‑purpose” cast functions—​such as `NNReal.coe_nat_cast`—​disappear; you now rely on the generic `Coe`/`CoeTC` instances and the `↑` notation, backed by standard lemmas like `Nat.cast_mul`.

Okay, here's a summary of the issues we've addressed in PPNP.Dev.New_RET.lean and related files:

Initial Lemma Name and Usage (exists_nat_pow_bounds):

Issue: The proof initially used a lemma named exists_nat_pow_near x_real hb_real_gt_1. This lemma either didn't exist or was misremembered. The actual lemma exists_nat_pow_bounds required different arguments: a proof for the base b ≥ 2 (hb_ge2) and a proof for the value x ≥ 1 (hx_real_ge_1).
Resolution: We corrected the call to exists_nat_pow_bounds hb_ge2 hx_real_ge_1.
Converting Real Power Bounds to Natural Number Bounds:

Issue: The proof attempted to manually convert inequalities like (↑b : ℝ) ^ k ≤ (↑n : ℝ) ^ m to b ^ k ≤ n ^ m using rwa [Nat.cast_pow, Nat.cast_pow]. This failed because Nat.cast_pow is ↑(a^b) = (↑a)^b, and the rewrite was needed in the reverse direction (← Nat.cast_pow).
Resolution: We used an existing helper lemma nat_bounds_from_cast_pow_bounds from PPNP.Common.Basic which correctly handles this conversion.
Rewriting let-defined terms in pl_bk:

Issue: Inside the split_ifs for proving pl_bk, the tactic rw [hk_cond, pow_zero] failed to rewrite k within f0_bk_pow_nnreal because f0_bk_pow_nnreal was defined as f0 hH_axioms (b ^ k), and rw didn't automatically unfold it.
Resolution: We used change f0 hH_axioms (b ^ k) = ... to explicitly unfold f0_bk_pow_nnreal before applying the rewrites.
Order of Rewrites for Monotonicity Hypotheses:

Issue: The command rw [pl_nm, pl_bk, pl_bkp1] at h_f0_mono1 h_f0_mono2 failed. pl_bk (which rewrites f0_bk_pow_nnreal) couldn't find its target in h_f0_mono2 after pl_nm had already modified h_f0_mono2.
Resolution: We split the rewrites: rw [pl_bk, pl_nm] at h_f0_mono1 and rw [pl_nm, pl_bkp1] at h_f0_mono2.
Proving Positivity of f0b_nnreal (h_f0b_real_pos):

Issue: uniformEntropy_pos_of_nontrivial_new returns f0 hH_axioms b ≠ 0, but the coe_pos simp lemma expected 0 < f0b_nnreal (as an ℝ≥0 inequality).
Initial Fix Attempt: Using (NNReal.pos_iff_ne_zero _).mpr was correct in principle, but there was a subtle type mismatch: the argument to mpr was f0 hH_axioms b ≠ 0 while NNReal.pos_iff_ne_zero expected a term of the form f0b_nnreal ≠ 0.
Resolution: We created a new helper lemma f0_pos_of_nontrivial_nnreal_version in PPNP.Dev.Dev.lean. This lemma encapsulates the logic of using uniformEntropy_pos_of_nontrivial_new and NNReal.pos_iff_ne_zero to directly provide 0 < f0 hH_axioms b. This new lemma was then used in New_RET.lean.
Simplifying Goal in k=0 Case (Left Inequality):

Issue: The simp tactic didn't fully reduce the goal to 0 ≤ ..., and exact NNReal.coe_nonneg _ failed due to type mismatch.
Resolution: We refined the simp call to simp only [hk0_case, Nat.cast_zero, zero_div] to ensure the goal became 0 ≤ (f0n_nnreal:ℝ)/(f0b_nnreal:ℝ). Then, apply div_nonneg with appropriate proofs for numerator and denominator solved it.
Simplifying if in Hypothesis (h_f0_mono1 for k > 0):

Issue: rw [if_neg hk0_case] at h_f0_mono1 failed to simplify the if k = 0 then ... else ... expression in h_f0_mono1.
Resolution: Replaced with simp [hk0_case] at h_f0_mono1, which is generally more robust for simplifying if statements using known conditions.
Coercion Lemma Names and simp Progress:

Issue: An unknown identifier coe_nat_cast was used. The simp only tactic also failed to make progress in preparing the goal for NNReal.coe_le_coe.mpr.
Resolution:
Corrected coe_nat_cast to NNReal.coe_natCast and coe_mul to NNReal.coe_mul.
Replaced simp only [...] with a sequence of explicit rw commands:
rw [← NNReal.coe_natCast k, ← NNReal.coe_natCast m]
rw [← NNReal.coe_mul, ← NNReal.coe_mul]
rw [NNReal.coe_le_coe] This step-by-step transformation was necessary because simp alone wasn't arranging the terms (especially coercions of Nat to Real via ℝ≥0) into the precise syntactic form ↑X ≤ ↑Y (where X, Y are ℝ≥0) that NNReal.coe_le_coe expects.
Term Order Mismatch after Coercion Rewrites (Left Inequality):

Issue: After applying NNReal.coe_le_coe, the goal was (k:ℝ≥0)*f0b_nnreal ≤ (f0n_nnreal:ℝ≥0)*(m:ℝ≥0), but the hypothesis h_f0_mono1 was (k:ℝ≥0)*f0b_nnreal ≤ (m:ℝ≥0)*(f0n_nnreal:ℝ≥0). The terms on the right-hand side were commuted. This order difference stemmed from how div_le_div_iff₀ structures its result.
Resolution: Added conv_rhs => rw [mul_comm] to reorder the terms on the right-hand side of the goal to match h_f0_mono1.
Rewriting ↑(k+1 : ℕ) (Right Inequality):

Issue: The term (((k+1):ℕ):ℝ) in the goal was often simplified by Lean to ((k:ℝ) + 1). The rewrite rw [← NNReal.coe_natCast (k+1)] expected to find ↑(k+1 : ℕ) (as a Real number) literally.
Resolution: We inserted rw [← Nat.cast_add_one k] before rw [← NNReal.coe_natCast (k+1)]. This converts (↑k + 1) back to the form ↑(k+1 : ℕ), allowing NNReal.coe_natCast to apply correctly.
In essence, many issues revolved around the intricacies of Lean's type coercion system (especially between ℕ, ℝ≥0, and ℝ), the precise syntactic requirements of rewrite tactics, and ensuring hypotheses and goals matched not just semantically but often syntactically for tactics like rw and exact to work as expected. When direct approaches were problematic, creating specific helper lemmas or using more targeted sequences of rewrites proved effective.

## Major Shifts at a Glance  

### 1 · Unified Syntax & Macro‑Based Tactics  
* **Single language** for terms *and* tactics—​both are Lean code expanded by macros rather than a hard‑wired tactic DSL. ([Review of Lean 4 : r/haskell - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/z55hha/review_of_lean_4/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Tactics - Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/tactics.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* Snake‑case keywords, new `by`/`exact?` sugar, and cleaned‑up binder syntax replace many Lean 3 idioms. ([Lean 4 survival guide for Lean 3 users - GitHub](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Lean-4-survival-guide-for-Lean-3-users?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Topic: tactic naming convention - Zulip Chat Archive](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/tactic.20naming.20convention.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

### 2 · Library & Namespacing Overhaul  
* `mathlib4` is a fresh port; many combinators were renamed or dropped to favour type‑class‑driven patterns. ([What will happen to mathlib when we transition to Lean 4?](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/274/what-will-happen-to-mathlib-when-we-transition-to-lean-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
* Numbers live in `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Cast.Basic`, `Mathlib.Data.Real.NNReal`, etc.; imports are more granular. ([Mathlib.Data.Nat.Cast.Basic - Lean community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Nat/Cast/Basic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

### 3 · Coercion Paradigm  
| Lean 3 style | Lean 4 style | Why it changed |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Explicit helpers (`nat_cast_le`, `NNReal.coe_nat_cast`, …) | Generic coercion via `↑` and `Coe` instances | Less surface API, uniform reasoning  ([How to perform type conversion/coercion in Lean 4?](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/4113/how-to-perform-type-conversion-coercion-in-lean-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Coercions - Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/type-classes/coercion.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| Proofs relied on unfolding those helpers | Proofs use `simp`, `Nat.cast_*`, `Algebra.*` lemmas | Fewer rewrites; `simp` knows about `CoeTC`  ([Coercions - Lean](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/Coercions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [12.2.

## Practical Guide: Working with Casts in Lean 4  

1. **Import the right files.**  
   ```lean
   import Mathlib.Data.Real.NNReal
   import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Cast.Basic
   ```  
   These bring in the `Coe` instances and `Nat.cast_*` lemmas you need. ([Mathlib.Data.Nat.Cast.Basic - Lean community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Nat/Cast/Basic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

2. **Use `↑`.**  
   Writing `(n : ℝ≥0)` or simply `↑(n : ℝ≥0)` triggers the `CoeTC` machinery; no function call is required. ([How to perform type conversion/coercion in Lean 4?](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/4113/how-to-perform-type-conversion-coercion-in-lean-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Coercions - Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/type-classes/coercion.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

3. **Lean inserts chains automatically.**  
   If there is `Nat → Int` and `Int → ℝ`, Lean can coerce `Nat` → `ℝ` by chaining. ([Coercions - Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/type-classes/coercion.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Coercions - Functional Programming in Lean](https://docs.lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/type-classes/coercion.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

4. **Lean knows arithmetic facts about casts.**  
   Lemmas like `Nat.cast_mul`, `Nat.cast_add`, `Nat.cast_pow` work for *any* semiring target, so `simp` can finish many goals. ([Mathlib.Data.Nat.Cast.Basic - Lean community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Data/Nat/Cast/Basic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

5. **Equality over `NNReal`** often reduces to equality over `ℝ` via `NNReal.eq` plus `simp` on `NNReal.coe_*` lemmas. ([Zulip Chat Archive - Lean community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/coercion.20from.20Nat.20to.20ENat.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Porting Checklist for Coercions  

* 🔍 **Search for old helpers** such as `nat_abs_cast`, `coe_nat`, `coe_nat_cast`, etc.  
* 🔄 **Replace** them with `↑n : target_type` and rely on `simp` lemmas.  
* 🧹 **Delete unwrap/rewrap code**; `simp [NNReal.coe_mul]` + `Nat.cast_*` normally suffices.  
* ✅ **Add `open scoped NNReal`** for notation like `((n : ℝ≥0) * m)`.

## Worked Example (revisited)  

```lean
lemma nnreal_coe_nat_mul (n m : ℕ) :
    ((n : ℝ≥0) * m) = (n * m : ℝ≥0) := by
  apply NNReal.eq
  simp [NNReal.coe_mul, Nat.cast_mul]      -- ‹↑n * ↑m = ↑(n*m)›
```  

*No bespoke cast function, just coercions and two `simp` lemmas.*
