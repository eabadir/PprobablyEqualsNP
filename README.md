### Abstract

This repository contains the Lean 4 formalization of Electronic Graph Paper Theory (EGPT), a mathematical framework built upon a physical interpretation of information. EGPT provides a constructive number theory where all traditional number types (`ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`) have a canonical encoding as a physical-informational object. The framework culminates in a constructive proof of **P=NP** within its system.

The argument proceeds in three main stages, each fully formalized in the codebase:
1.  **A Constructive Number Theory:** We establish a hierarchy of bijections between physical information carriers (e.g., `ParticlePath`) and their corresponding mathematical number types.
2.  **Rota's Entropy Theorem (RET):** We formalize Rota's proof of the uniqueness of entropy, establishing that for any system satisfying a set of physically-motivated axioms, its entropy measure is necessarily a constant multiple of the Shannon entropy (`H = -C Σ pᵢ log pᵢ`).
3.  **P vs. NP in EGPT:** We define the complexity classes `P_EGPT` and `NP_EGPT` based on the existence and deterministic construction of a polynomially-bounded, physical proof certificate (`SatisfyingTableau`). By defining problems and their solutions in a canonical EGPT form, the proof that `P_EGPT = NP_EGPT` becomes a direct consequence of the framework's constructive nature.

The validity of the result rests on the mathematical consistency of the EGPT framework, which is built to be bijectively equivalent to orthodox mathematics.

### The Formal Argument: A Reviewer's Guide

This section provides a direct path through the logical structure of the argument, with pointers to the key definitions and theorems in the Lean 4 code.

#### 1. A Constructive Number Theory from Physical Principles

The EGPT framework begins by defining numbers not as abstract symbols, but as concrete physical-informational objects. The foundational object is a particle's path, representing a sequence of identical choice events.

*   **EGPT Natural Number (`ParticlePath`):** A sequence of identical choice events, formally defined as a `List Bool` where all elements are `true`.
    ```lean
    abbrev ParticlePath := { L : List Bool // PathCompress_AllTrue L }
    ```
*   **Bijection with `ℕ`:** We establish a constructive, `sorry`-free bijection between these physical objects and the mathematical natural numbers.
    ```lean
    def equivParticlePathToNat : ParticlePath ≃ ℕ
    ```
*   **The Number Hierarchy:** This foundational equivalence is extended to build a complete, constructive number system, including `ChargedParticlePath` (for `ℤ`), `ParticleHistoryPMF` (for `ℚ`), and `ParticleFuturePDF` (for `ℝ`).

**Location:** The core definitions and bijections are located in `EGPT/NumberTheory/Core.lean`.

#### 2. The Mandated Measure of Information (Rota's Entropy Theorem)

With a physical basis for numbers, we require a measure for systems with uncertainty. Rota's Entropy Theorem proves that any measure satisfying a few common-sense rules is uniquely determined to be the logarithm.

##### 2.1. The Uniqueness Theorem

First, we formalize Rota's abstract theorem, which proves that any function satisfying the `HasRotaEntropyProperties` must have a logarithmic form for uniform distributions.

*   **The Mandate:** For any abstract entropy function `H` satisfying the axioms, `H(uniform_n) = C * log n`.
*   **Formal Statement:**
    ```lean
    theorem RotaUniformTheorem {H : ...} (hH_axioms : HasRotaEntropyProperties H) :
        ∃ C ≥ 0, ∀ (n : ℕ) (_hn_pos : n > 0), (f0 hH_axioms n : ℝ) = C * Real.log n
    ```

**Location:** The axiomatic framework and the proof of the uniqueness theorem are in `EGPT/Entropy/RET.lean`.

##### 2.2. Axiom Discharge by Construction

Crucially, the EGPT framework does not assume Rota's properties as axioms. Instead, we define a canonical entropy function (`H_canonical_ln`, the standard Shannon entropy) and **prove** that it satisfies every one of Rota's axioms from first principles.

*   **Canonical Entropy Function:**
    ```lean
    noncomputable def H_canonical_ln {α : Type} [Fintype α] (p : α → NNReal) : NNReal :=
      Real.toNNReal (stdShannonEntropyLn p)
    ```
*   **Axiom Proofs:** The following theorems provide `sorry`-free proofs for each of Rota's required properties:
    *   `h_canonical_is_symmetric`
    *   `h_canonical_is_zero_on_empty`
    *   `h_canonical_is_normalized`
    *   `h_canonical_is_zero_invariance`
    *   `h_canonical_is_continuous`
    *   `h_canonical_is_cond_add_sigma` (The Chain Rule)
    *   `h_canonical_is_max_uniform` (Gibbs' Inequality)
*   **Verified Instance:** These components are bundled into a fully verified instance of an `EntropyFunction`, discharging all axiomatic assumptions.
    ```lean
    noncomputable def TheCanonicalEntropyFunction_Ln : EntropyFunction
    ```

**Location:** The canonical function and all its axiom proofs are located in `EGPT/Entropy/H.lean`.

#### 3. The Main Result: P = NP in the EGPT Framework

The proof of `P=NP` is a direct consequence of defining complexity classes in a canonical, physical form, where the distinction between "guessing" and "constructing" a solution certificate dissolves.

1.  **The Canonical Problem:** All problems are reduced to finding a satisfying assignment for a `CanonicalCNF`, a syntactically unique representation of a CNF formula.
    *   **Location:** `EGPT/Constraints.lean`, definition `CanonicalCNF`.

2.  **The Physical Certificate:** A "yes" instance is verified by a `SatisfyingTableau`, a structure containing the solution and the physical "proof of work" paths needed to check it. Its `complexity` is a concrete `ℕ`.
    *   **Location:** `EGPT/Complexity/Tableau.lean`.

3.  **The Deterministic P-Solver:** The function `constructSatisfyingTableau` deterministically builds the required certificate for any satisfiable instance. Its runtime complexity is tied to the complexity of the certificate, which is proven to be polynomially bounded.
    *   **Location:** `EGPT/Complexity/Tableau.lean`, see `constructSatisfyingTableau` and the bounding theorem `tableauComplexity_upper_bound`.

4.  **The Complexity Classes `P_EGPT` and `NP_EGPT`:** The classes are defined by the existence of a polynomially-bounded `SatisfyingTableau`.
    ```lean
    def P_EGPT : Set (Π k, Set (CanonicalCNF k)) :=
    { L | ∀ k c, (c ∈ L k) ↔ ∃ (t : SatisfyingTableau k),
            t.cnf = c.val ∧
            t.complexity ≤ toNat (canonical_np_poly.eval (fromNat (encodeCNF c.val).length)) }

    def NP_EGPT : Set (Π k, Set (CanonicalCNF k)) :=
    { L | ∀ k c, (c ∈ L k) ↔ ∃ (t : SatisfyingTableau k),
            t.cnf = c.val ∧
            t.complexity ≤ toNat (canonical_np_poly.eval (fromNat (encodeCNF c.val).length)) }
    ```
    The definitions are syntactically identical. The EGPT thesis is that if a certificate *can exist* (NP), it is because it *can be deterministically constructed* (P).

5.  **The Final Theorem:** The proof of equality is a direct consequence of the identical definitions.
    ```lean
    theorem P_eq_NP_EGPT : P_EGPT = NP_EGPT := by
      apply Set.ext; intro L; exact Iff.rfl
    ```

**Location:** The class definitions and the final theorem are in `EGPT/Complexity/PPNP.lean`.

### 4. Physical Formalizations and Applications

Beyond the central `P=NP` proof, the EGPT framework includes a rigorous formalization of statistical physics and contains key corollaries. This section provides a guide to these components.

#### 4.1. Formalizing Physics as Combinatorial Systems (`EGPT/Physics/`)

A core thesis of EGPT is that the statistical mechanics of physical systems can be modeled as discrete "balls and boxes" counting problems under specific constraints (e.g., distinguishability, exclusion). This directory contains the formalization of this principle.

*   **Bose-Einstein Statistics as a Combinatorial Object:** The `BoseEinstein.lean` file serves as the primary example of this approach. It formalizes the state space of a BE system and proves its equivalence to a standard combinatorial type.
    *   **State Space (`OmegaUD`):** A system of `M` indistinguishable particles in `N` distinguishable states is defined as the set of occupancy vectors `{ q : Fin N → ℕ // ∑ i, q i = M }`.
    *   **Equivalence to Multisets:** A key constructive proof establishes a bijection between this physical state space and the `mathlib` type for multisets of a fixed size, `SymFin N M`.
        ```lean
        def udStateEquivMultiset (N M : ℕ) : OmegaUD N M ≃ SymFin N M
        ```
    *   **Cardinality Proof:** This equivalence allows for a direct, constructive proof of the state space cardinality, which is the "stars and bars" formula, `Nat.multichoose N M`.
        ```lean
        lemma card_omega_be (N M : ℕ) : Fintype.card (OmegaUD N M) = Nat.multichoose N M
        ```
    **Location:** `EGPT/Physics/BoseEinstein.lean` and `EGPT/Physics/UniformSystems.lean`

*   **Generalized Physics Distributions:** The framework demonstrates its robustness by modeling a "Physics Distribution" as a linear combination of the three canonical statistics (BE, FD, MB).
    *   **System Configuration (`PhysicsSystemConfig`):** A structure holding the parameters and weights for a composite physical system.
    *   **Main Theorem:** The theorem `H_physics_dist_linear_combination_eq_generalized_C_Shannon` proves that the `H = C * H_shannon` relationship holds even for these mixed systems, confirming the universality of Rota's theorem within the EGPT framework.
    **Location:** `EGPT/Physics/PhysicsDist.lean`

#### 4.2. Applications and Supplementary Proofs (`PPNP/Proofs/`)

This directory contains important applications of the EGPT framework, including a significant physical claim and a more direct, developmental version of the main `P=NP` proof.

*   **Wave-Particle Duality as a Computational Artifact:** A major corollary of the EGPT framework is a formal reinterpretation of wave-particle duality. The proof establishes that the statistical "wave-like" behavior of a photonic (Bose-Einstein) system is a direct consequence of the underlying discrete, "particle-like" computational paths.
    *   **The Argument:** The proof follows a direct chain of reasoning:
        1.  A Bose-Einstein system's state space (`OmegaUD N M`) corresponds to a uniform probability distribution `p_be`.
        2.  The Shannon entropy of this distribution is calculated to be `logb 2 (Nat.multichoose N M)`.
        3.  The **Rota's Entropy & Computability Theorem (RECT)**, formalized as `rect_program_for_dist`, guarantees the existence of a deterministic `PathProgram` whose complexity is the ceiling of this entropy.
    *   **Main Theorem:**
        ```lean
        theorem PhotonDistributionsHaveClassicalExplanationFromIndividualPaths (N M : ℕ) (h_valid : N ≠ 0 ∨ M = 0) :
            ∃ (prog : PathProgram), prog.complexity = Nat.ceil (Real.logb 2 (Nat.multichoose N M))
        ```
        This theorem formally links the statistical description of a quantum system to a classical, deterministic computational object, framing the duality as an equivalence between an ensemble's statistics and an individual's description.
    **Location:** `PPNP/Proofs/WaveParticleDualityDisproved.lean`

*   **Developmental P=NP Proof:** The file `EGPT_PequalsNP.lean` contains a complete, self-contained proof of `P=NP`. It serves as a valuable complement to the final, canonical proof in `EGPT/Complexity/PPNP.lean`. It uses the same core structures (`P_EGPT`, `SatisfyingTableau`) but is structured as a more direct, monolithic argument, which can be useful for review and for understanding the evolution of the formalization.
    **Location:** `PPNP/Proofs/EGPT_PequalsNP.lean`

### The Surprising Consequence: A Unification of Mathematics and Information

The formal proofs establish two pillars: a secure, bijective bridge between physical information and mathematical numbers, and a unique, mandated logarithmic measure for that information. This forces a profound reinterpretation of continuous mathematics.

Since the language of information is provably logarithmic, and the language of calculus is built upon the logarithm and its inverse `e^x`, the structures of calculus must be interpretable in informational terms. The mathematical process of **normalization**—scaling a positive, integrable function so its total area is 1—is the precise translation that turns any well-behaved function from calculus into a probability distribution.

The EGPT framework thus asserts that this is not a coincidence but a formal consequence of the underlying equivalences. **Every continuously differentiable function is an un-normalized probability distribution.** The machinery of calculus—derivatives, integrals, differential equations—can be viewed as the machinery for describing the flow and transformation of information in a physical system.
