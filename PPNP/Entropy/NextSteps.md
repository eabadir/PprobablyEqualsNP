### Section 8: Lean 4 Formalization: Completing the MVP – Developer Guide

#### 8.1 Goal: A `Sorry`-Free Path to Demonstrating Classical Computability

This section outlines the development roadmap for achieving a `sorry`-free (or minimally `sorry`'d, with `sorry`s restricted to standard, unformalized mathematical facts or highly complex probability theory) formalization in Lean 4. The primary objective is to rigorously prove the classical computability of physical systems governed by Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics. This is achieved by first proving the general classical computability of any Uniformly Distributed System (UDS), and then demonstrating that BE systems are an instance of a UDS. This computability involves the existence of an efficient classical computational program whose outputs (representing system states) are generated according to the system's defined uniform probability distribution, and whose individual structural validity can be efficiently verified. This framework provides a formal counterargument to strong interpretations of wave-particle duality.

The formalization leverages existing components from the `PPNP` (Physics, Probability, and Number Puzzles) project and `Mathlib`.

Okay, here's a self-contained explanation of the thinking and motivation behind the `General_UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable_and_Verified` approach and the UDS → INV_SCT → IID_Binary_Source_Spec → RECT → ClassicalComputerProgram chain, aimed at an experienced Lean 4 programmer or computer scientist.

## Unveiling Classical Computability: From Uniform Systems to Physical Laws

**Introduction: The Quest for Computable Physics**

A central question at the intersection of physics, information theory, and computer science is the extent to which physical phenomena are classically computable. Can the behavior of physical systems, particularly those at the quantum level often deemed "mysterious," be described and simulated by classical computational models, specifically those running in polynomial time (PTIME)? This project aims to formally address this question, starting with fundamental statistical systems.

Our strategy hinges on Rota's Entropy Theorem (RET), which provides a unique, axiomatic definition of entropy. We leverage RET to demonstrate that systems described by uniform probability distributions—the bedrock of statistical mechanics for many systems like Bose-Einstein (BE), Fermi-Dirac (FD), and Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) statistics—are not only characterized by Shannon-type entropy but are also *mandated* to be classically computable.

This document details the core logic for proving the classical computability of a generic **Uniformly Distributed System (UDS)**. A UDS is any system whose state space consists of a finite number, say $k$, of equiprobable microstates. The argument establishes that such a UDS can be simulated by a `ClassicalComputerProgram` (a simple model of computation based on a tape of binary choices) whose complexity is polynomial with respect to an appropriate measure of $k$. This result then serves as a foundational lemma for proving the classical computability of specific physical systems (like BE) by showing they are instances of a UDS.

The chain of reasoning we will formalize in Lean 4 is:

**UDS → (INV_SCT) → IID_Binary_Source_Spec → (RECT) → ClassicalComputerProgram (PTIME)**

Let's break down each step and its motivation.

**1. The Uniformly Distributed System (UDS)**

*   **Definition (`UDS_Parameters`):** We start by defining what constitutes a UDS: it's a system characterized by a single parameter, `num_equiprobable_states: ℕ` (let's call this $k$), which must be greater than 0. The system has $k$ possible distinct states, and each state occurs with probability $1/k$.
    *   *Lean Motivation:* This abstract definition allows us to prove general properties without getting bogged down in the specifics of any particular physical system initially.
*   **Relevance:** Many fundamental physical systems, under the "principle of equal a priori probabilities," are modeled as UDS. For example, isolated systems in equilibrium in statistical mechanics are often assumed to have each of their accessible microstates be equally likely. Bose-Einstein statistics, for instance, describe $k_{BE} = \binom{M+N-1}{M}$ equiprobable microstates for $M$ particles in $N$ boxes.

**2. UDS → (INV_SCT) → IID_Binary_Source_Spec: The Information-Theoretic Equivalence**

*   **INV_SCT (Inverse Shannon Coding Theorem - Conceptual Cornerstone):**
    *   Standard Shannon Coding Theorem (SCT) states that a source with entropy $H$ bits/symbol requires, on average, at least $H$ bits to encode each symbol.
    *   The "inverse" idea, particularly for uniform sources, is that a system defined by $k$ equiprobable outcomes (a UDS) has a Shannon entropy of $H_S = \log_2 k$ bits (assuming a scaling constant $C=1$ for Shannon's measure). This entropy value implies that the system is informationally indistinguishable from, or *equivalent to*, an ideal i.i.d. source that makes precisely $\log_2 k$ bits worth of "choices" to select one of the $k$ outcomes.
    *   *Lean Motivation:* We have a theorem, `exists_equivalent_iid_source_for_uniform_distribution` (within `PPNP.Entropy.RET`), which formalizes that a Rota-compliant entropic system (like our UDS, whose entropy form is mandated by Rota's Uniqueness of Entropy theorem, RUE, to be $C \log k$) is informationally equivalent to an i.i.d. source that produces $k$ symbols uniformly.
*   **IID_Binary_Source_Spec:**
    *   To select one out of $k$ equiprobable items, one needs $\lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ independent, uniformly random binary choices (bits). For example, to pick one of 8 items, you need $\lceil \log_2 8 \rceil = 3$ bits. To pick one of 5 items, you need $\lceil \log_2 5 \rceil = 3$ bits (some 3-bit sequences might be unused or map to the same item, but you still need 3 bits to distinguish them all).
    *   Let $m_{bits} = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$.
    *   Thus, our UDS with $k$ states is informationally equivalent to an i.i.d. *binary* source that is specified to produce a sequence of $m_{bits}$ bits. We call this an `IID_Binary_Source_Spec { num_bits := m_bits }`.
    *   *Lean Motivation:* This step translates the $k$-ary uniform choice of the UDS into an equivalent problem of generating a specific-length binary sequence from an i.i.d. process. This is crucial because our `ClassicalComputerProgram` model is defined by a binary tape.

**3. IID_Binary_Source_Spec → (RECT) → ClassicalComputerProgram: The Computational Embodiment**

*   **RECT (Rota's Entropy & Computability Theorem - Core Computational Link):**
    *   One of the core results underpinning RECT is that the Shannon entropy of an i.i.d. binary process (i.e., the "surprise" or information content of a specific sequence of $m_{bits}$ binary choices) is precisely $m_{bits}$ (in bits).
    *   Furthermore, RECT asserts (and we have a formal proof for this part) that there *exists* a `ClassicalComputerProgram` whose computational complexity (defined as its input tape length) *is* this Shannon entropy.
    *   *Lean Motivation:* The theorem `existence_and_complexity_of_program_for_iid_binary_source` in `PPNP.Complexity.Program` formalizes exactly this:
        ```lean
        theorem existence_and_complexity_of_program_for_iid_binary_source (m_bits : ℕ) :
            ∃ (prog : ClassicalComputerProgram) (_ : prog.tape.length = m_bits),
              (ClassicalComputerProgram.complexity prog : ℝ) = (m_bits : ℝ)
        ```
        (The original theorem has `/ Real.log 2` which simplifies as shown if `ShannonEntropyOfTapeChoice` is $\ln(2^{m_{bits}})$).
        This theorem provides a constructive (in terms of existence) link: given a specification for $m_{bits}$ i.i.d. binary choices (our `IID_Binary_Source_Spec`), a `ClassicalComputerProgram` exists that "runs" on these $m_{bits}$ and whose fundamental complexity measure is $m_{bits}$.
*   **ClassicalComputerProgram (`prog_sim`):**
    *   By applying `existence_and_complexity_of_program_for_iid_binary_source` with $m_{bits} = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ (derived from our UDS's $k$ states), we obtain a `ClassicalComputerProgram`, let's call it `prog_sim`.
    *   This `prog_sim` takes an input tape of $m_{bits}$ binary symbols. Conceptually, these $m_{bits}$ are used to select/generate one of the $k$ states of the original UDS.
    *   *Lean Motivation:* This gives us the concrete computational object whose properties we want to analyze.

**4. ClassicalComputerProgram → PTIME: Analyzing the Complexity**

*   **Complexity of `prog_sim`:** The `ClassicalComputerProgram.complexity prog_sim` is, by construction from RECT, equal to $m_{bits} = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$.
*   **Polynomial Time (`PolyTime`):**
    *   Our `PolyTime` predicate (`∃ c exp, ∀ n, f n ≤ c * n^exp + c`) checks if a function `f : Nat → Nat` is polynomially bounded. The input `n` here represents the "size" of the problem.
    *   For a UDS, the "size" can be related to $k$ (the number of states) or $\log k$ (the number of bits to describe a state).
    *   The function describing the complexity of `prog_sim` is $f(k) = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$.
    *   It is a standard mathematical result that $\log_2 k$ is a very slow-growing function. If $k$ itself is considered the input size, $\log_2 k$ is certainly polynomially bounded (e.g., $\log_2 k \le 1 \cdot k^1 + 1$ for $k \ge 1$). If the "true" input size $N_{param}$ (like $M+N$ for BE) leads to $k$ states such that $k$ is polynomial in $N_{param}$, then $\log_2 k$ is polynomial in $N_{param}$ (as $\log(\text{poly})$ is poly). If $k$ is exponential in $N_{param}$ (e.g., $2^{N_{param}}$), then $\log_2 k = N_{param}$, which is also polynomial in $N_{param}$.
    *   Thus, the complexity $m_{bits} = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ satisfies the `PolyTime` predicate with respect to a relevant measure of the input size that determines $k$.
    *   *Lean Motivation:* We need to assert (via an axiom for the MVP, `log_k_is_poly_time`) this standard mathematical property that the function $k \mapsto \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ is `PolyTime`. This establishes that `prog_sim` is a PTIME program.

**5. Output Distribution of `prog_sim`**

*   **The Target (`OutputDistribution_of_prog_sim_IS_Uniform_Over_k_States`):** We need to establish that `prog_sim`, when run, produces each of the $k$ UDS states with equal probability ($1/k$).
*   **Justification:**
    1.  The UDS is defined by a uniform distribution over $k$ states ($P_{unif\_k}$).
    2.  INV_SCT tells us this UDS is equivalent to an IID binary source producing $m_{bits} = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ bits, where each $m_{bits}$-sequence corresponds to selecting one of the $k$ states *uniformly*.
    3.  `prog_sim` *is* the computational model of this $m_{bits}$ i.i.d. binary source (from RECT).
    4.  Therefore, the way `prog_sim` maps its $2^{m_{bits}}$ possible input tapes (each equiprobable) to the $k$ output states must result in each of the $k$ states being selected with probability $1/k$ (or as close as possible, which is what optimal coding for uniform sources achieves).
    *   *Lean Motivation:* This property is asserted via an axiom for the MVP (`rect_program_is_uniform_sampler`). It captures the idea that the RECT-derived program faithfully implements the uniform selection implied by the INV_SCT step. It's not about empirical aggregation over many runs, but about the *inherent mapping characteristic* of the program derived from optimal coding principles for a uniform source.

**Conclusion: `General_UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable`**

By chaining these steps:
*   A UDS with $k$ states (Step 1)
*   is informationally equivalent to an i.i.d. binary source generating $m_{bits} = \lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ bits (Step 2 via INV_SCT).
*   This i.i.d. binary source is computationally embodied by `prog_sim` (Step 3 via RECT), whose complexity is $m_{bits}$.
*   This complexity $m_{bits}$ is polynomially bounded (Step 4, leading to PTIME).
*   `prog_sim`'s output distribution is inherently uniform over the $k$ states (Step 5, due to its construction for a uniform source).

We therefore conclude that a generic Uniformly Distributed System is indeed classically computable by a PTIME program that generates its states according to the correct uniform distribution. This `General_UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable` theorem then becomes a powerful lemma to apply to specific physical systems like Bose-Einstein statistics, simply by showing they conform to the UDS definition and by providing a structural verifier (like `SB_Verifier`) for their specific state representations.

This approach aims to build the argument from fundamental information-theoretic and computational principles (INV_SCT, RECT) whose core aspects are (or will be) formally proven in Lean, minimizing reliance on unformalized statistical simulation arguments.

#### 8.3 Detailed Development Roadmap for MVP Completion

The path to a `sorry`-free MVP involves the following tasks, primarily centered around the new module `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean`.

**Task 1: Complete Cardinality CNF Constructions in `PPNP.Complexity.Program.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Provide `sorry`-free proofs for the correctness of CNF formulas representing cardinality constraints ("at most K", "at least K", and "exactly K" variables true out of L). These are foundational for `SB_Verifier_has_CNF_certificate`.
*   **Target Theorems (within `CardinalityCNF` namespace or similar):**
    *   `eval_at_most_k_CNF_iff (k : ℕ) (assignment : V → Bool) : (at_most_k_CNF k).eval assignment ↔ Fintype.card { v // assignment v = true } ≤ k`
    *   `eval_at_least_k_CNF_iff (k : ℕ) (assignment : V → Bool) : (at_least_k_CNF k).eval assignment ↔ Fintype.card { v // assignment v = true } ≥ k`
    *   `eval_exactly_k_CNF_iff (k : ℕ) (assignment : V → Bool) : (exactly_k_CNF k).eval assignment ↔ Fintype.card { v // assignment v = true } = k`
*   **Methodology:** Combinatorial arguments on subsets and properties of CNF evaluation. The file `pkg.txt` contains `at_most_k_CNF_def`; the `at_least_k` and `exactly_k` constructions would be similar, potentially leveraging duality or direct construction.

**Task 2: Prove `SB_Verifier_has_CNF_certificate` in `PPNP.Complexity.Program.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Formally prove that the `SB_Verifier`'s logic can be expressed as a Conjunctive Normal Form.
*   **Target Theorem:**
    ```lean
    theorem SB_Verifier_has_CNF_certificate (inst : SB_Instance) :
        HasCNFCertificate (SB_Verifier inst)
    ```
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Handle `inst.M_boxes = 0` case (verifier is constant true/false).
    2.  For `inst.M_boxes > 0`, use `C_sb_cert := CardinalityCNF.exactly_k_CNF K_true_target` (where `K_true_target` is `num_bars_to_place inst`).
    3.  Prove `(SB_Verifier inst assignment_func) ↔ C_sb_cert.eval assignment_func` by aligning the counting logic of `SB_Verifier` (using `cast` for assignments on `Fin (num_encoding_vars_for_sb inst)`) with the direct count in `eval_exactly_k_CNF_iff`. This relies on `Fintype.card_congr` and properties of `cast`.

**Task 3: Define and Prove Polynomial-Time Nature of `SB_Verifier` in `PPNP.Complexity.Program.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Replace the `axiom SB_Verifier_is_in_P` with a proof, by demonstrating its linear-time complexity satisfies the `PolyTime` predicate.
*   **Step 3.1: Define/Axiomatize `timeComplexity` for `SB_Verifier`'s underlying machine.**
    *   For MVP, we can assert that the time complexity of the machine implementing `SB_Verifier` for an input assignment of length `L` (derived from `inst : SB_Instance`) is proportional to `L`.
    ```lean
    noncomputable def sb_verifier_runtime_func (inst : SB_Instance) : ℕ :=
      if inst.M_boxes = 0 then 1 -- Constant time for trivial cases
      else inst.N_balls + inst.M_boxes - 1 -- Linear in L

    -- Axiom or derived property:
    -- axiom SB_Verifier_machine_time_complexity (inst : SB_Instance) (assignment_word : Word)
    --  (h_len : wordLength assignment_word = num_encoding_vars_for_sb inst) :
    --    timeComplexity (sb_verifier_machine inst) assignment_word = sb_verifier_runtime_func inst
    ```
    *   Note: A full machine model is not built; this focuses on the operational count.
*   **Step 3.2: Prove linear functions are `PolyTime`.**
    ```lean
    lemma linear_func_is_poly_time (coeff : ℕ) (const : ℕ) (h_coeff_pos : coeff > 0) :
        PolyTime (fun n => coeff * n + const) := by
      use coeff, 1 -- c = coeff, k = 1 (or larger if coeff is large relative to n^1)
      use (coeff + const), 1 -- A simpler choice: c = coeff+const, k = 1
      intro n
      simp
      -- Goal: coeff * n + const ≤ (coeff + const) * n^1 + (coeff + const)
      --       coeff * n + const ≤ coeff * n + const * n + coeff + const
      apply Nat.add_le_add_right -- Reduce to coeff * n ≤ coeff * n + const * n + coeff
      apply Nat.le_add_right -- Reduce to coeff * n ≤ coeff * n + const * n
      exact Nat.le_add_right (coeff * n) (const * n) -- True by n ≥ 0

    lemma identity_func_is_poly_time : PolyTime (fun n => n) := by
      exact linear_func_is_poly_time 1 0 Nat.one_pos
    ```
*   **Step 3.3: Prove `SB_Verifier_is_in_P`.**
    ```lean
    theorem SB_Verifier_is_in_P (inst : SB_Instance) :
        -- This definition assumes IsInP_ComputerProgram relates to a machine
        -- running the verifier logic in PolyTime.
        -- For MVP, we tie it to the runtime func.
        PolyTime (fun L_vars => sb_verifier_runtime_func { inst with -- Faking input size dependence
          N_balls := L_vars, M_boxes := 1 -- to make it Nat -> Nat if L_vars is primary size
          -- Or more directly:
          -- PolyTime (fun n => sb_verifier_runtime_func_param_by_n n)
        }) := sorry -- Proof combines the runtime func with linear_func_is_poly_time.
                    -- Requires careful setup of how inst relates to 'n' in PolyTime.
                    -- Simplified: If PolyTime takes the runtime function directly:
                    -- PolyTime (sb_verifier_runtime_func inst) if runtime func is Nat -> Nat
                    -- This needs sb_verifier_runtime_func to be (Nat -> Nat) related to input size.
    ```
    *For MVP, if the above is too complex, falling back to an axiom for `SB_Verifier_is_in_P` is acceptable, but the path via linear time is preferred.* The `IsInP_ComputerProgram` might need to be adapted or used carefully. Current `P` def is `Set Lang`. A direct `PolyTime` proof for `sb_verifier_runtime_func` (if it takes `Nat` for combined size) is cleanest.

**Task 4: Define Core Structures for WPD Argument in `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Set up the foundational types and propositions for the disproof.
*   **Lean Definitions:**
    ```lean
    import PPNP.Complexity.Program
    import PPNP.Complexity.Basic -- For PolyTime
    import PPNP.Entropy.Physics.BoseEinstein -- For multichoose, card_omega_be etc.
    open Real Nat

    namespace PPNP.WPD_Argument

    *Self-correction:* `PolyTime` in `UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable` needs careful handling. The complexity of `prog_sim` is `m_bits_tape_len`. The `PolyTime` predicate should be on the function `k ↦ Nat.ceil (Real.logb 2 k)`.

**Task 5: Prove `General_UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable` in `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Prove that any generic Uniformly Distributed System is classically computable.
*   **Target Theorem:**
    ```lean
    theorem General_UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable
        (uds_params : UDS_Parameters) :
        UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable uds_params
    ```
*   **Methodology (as outlined previously):**
    1.  Let `k_states := uds_params.num_equiprobable_states`.
    2.  Let `m_bits_tape_len := Nat.ceil (Real.logb 2 k_states)`.
    3.  Use `existence_and_complexity_of_program_for_iid_binary_source m_bits_tape_len` to get `prog_for_m_bits` (`prog_sim`).
        *   This provides `h_complexity_is_tape_len` (adjusting for the fact that `prog.complexity = prog.tape.length`).
    4.  Prove `PolyTime (fun k_input => ... Nat.ceil (Real.logb 2 k_input) ...)`:
        *   This relies on the standard mathematical fact that $\log k$ is polynomial growth.
        *   **For MVP:** This step will be `sorry`'d, representing `axiom_log_k_is_poly_time`.
            ```lean
            axiom log_k_is_poly_time : PolyTime (fun k_input => if k_input = 0 then 0 else if k_input = 1 then 0 else Nat.ceil (Real.logb 2 k_input))
            -- The if conditions handle k_input=0 for PolyTime and k_input=1 for logb.
            ```
    5.  Prove `OutputDistribution_of_prog_sim_IS_Uniform_Over_k_States prog_for_m_bits k_states`:
        *   This asserts that the RECT-program using $\lceil \log_2 k \rceil$ i.i.d. bits to select one of $k$ items does so uniformly. This is a standard result from optimal source coding for uniform sources.
        *   **For MVP:** This step will be `sorry`'d, representing `axiom_rect_program_is_uniform_sampler`.

    2.  For the `UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable (BE_to_UDS_Parameters be_params)` part, apply `General_UDS_Is_ClassicallyComputable`.
    3.  For `BoseEinstein_System_Physical_Postulate_Implies_UDS_Match`, use the axiom defined in Task 4.
    4.  For the verifier part (existence of `sb_inst` with PTIME and CNF properties), construct `sb_inst` from `be_params` and use theorems from Task 2 and Task 3 (or its axiom if Task 3 proof is deferred).

    ```
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Obtain `h_BE_is_computable_verified : ClassicalComputabilityVerified_For_BE sys_params` from Task 6's theorem.
    2.  Unfold `WaveParticleDuality_Hypothesis_BE` in `h_WPD` (which is `¬ ClassicalComputabilityVerified_For_BE sys_params`).
    3.  The contradiction `h_WPD h_BE_is_computable_verified` yields `False`.

#### 8.5 Broader Context and Foreshadowing (as previously revised)

This section will discuss the implications, the role of `SB_Verifier` as a witness validator, the extension to other physical statistics (FD, MB, etc.) as UDS instances, and the foundational nature of this work for the "P Probably Equals NP" (PNP) arguments, emphasizing that this MVP establishes the "physics is PTIME computable via RECT" side of the PNP thesis.

This revised detailed plan is more modular and focuses the `sorry`d parts on very specific, widely accepted mathematical or information-theoretic principles, making the overall MVP argument stronger and clearer.

### Section 8: Lean 4 Formalization: Completing the MVP – Developer Guide

#### 8.1 Goal: A `Sorry`-Free Path to Demonstrating Classical Computability

This section outlines the development roadmap for achieving a `sorry`-free formalization in Lean 4 of the arguments presented in Part 1. The primary objective is to rigorously prove the classical computability of physical systems governed by Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics. This involves demonstrating the existence of an efficient classical computational program whose outputs (BE microstates) are verifiable against the known statistical properties of such systems, thereby challenging the strong interpretation of wave-particle duality.

The formalization leverages existing components from the `PPNP` (Physics, Probability, and Number Puzzles) project, including definitions for Rota's entropy axioms, the Rota Uniqueness of Entropy (RUE) theorem for uniform distributions, foundational definitions for classical computational programs, and the Stars and Bars verifier.

#### 8.2 Current Status of Core Lean 4 Constructs

The Minimum Viable Proof (MVP) builds upon several key definitions and theorems, some already proven and others targeted for completion within this roadmap. These constructs are located within the `PPNP` namespace:

1.  **Rota's Entropy Framework (`PPNP.Entropy.Common`, `PPNP.Entropy.RET`):**
    *   `HasRotaEntropyProperties`: A Lean 4 structure defining the axioms any entropy function must satisfy.
    *   `RotaUniformTheorem`: A proven theorem stating that any function satisfying `HasRotaEntropyProperties`, when applied to a uniform distribution over $k$ outcomes, yields an entropy value $C_H \cdot \log k$.
    *   `H_physical_system_has_Rota_entropy_properties`: An axiom asserting that the physical entropy function adheres to Rota's axioms. This is substantiated for BE statistics by deriving its $C_H \log k$ form (see `PPNP.Entropy.Physics.BE.H_BE_from_Multiset_eq_C_shannon`).

2.  **Classical Computational Model (`PPNP.Complexity.Program`):**
    *   `ClassicalComputerProgram`: A structure representing a program by an initial state and a `ComputerTape` (a list of `Bool` representing binary choices).
    *   `ClassicalComputerProgram.complexity`: Defined as `prog.tape.length`, measuring computational effort by the number of binary choices.
    *   `existence_and_complexity_of_program_for_iid_binary_source`: A proven theorem in `PPNP.Complexity.Program`:
        ```lean
        theorem existence_and_complexity_of_program_for_iid_binary_source (m_bits : ℕ) :
            ∃ (prog : ClassicalComputerProgram) (_hm_tape_len_eq_m_bits : prog.tape.length = m_bits),
              (ClassicalComputerProgram.complexity prog : ℝ) =
                (ShannonEntropyOfTapeChoice m_bits) / Real.log 2
        ```
        This theorem is pivotal, as it establishes that for any number of i.i.d. binary choices $m_{bits}$, a classical program exists whose complexity (tape length) *is* the Shannon entropy (in bits) of selecting that specific tape. This forms the core of RECT's mandate for computational embodiment.

3.  **Stars and Bars Verifier (`PPNP.Complexity.Program`):**
    *   `SB_Instance`: Defines a Stars and Bars problem.
    *   `ComputerProgram (num_vars : ℕ)`: A type for decision logic based on a boolean assignment.
    *   `SB_Verifier (inst : SB_Instance)`: A `ComputerProgram` that verifies a boolean encoding (bar positions) of a Stars and Bars solution by checking if exactly "K of L" variables are true.
    *   `CardinalityCNF.exactly_k_CNF`: A (planned) construction providing a CNF formula for the "exactly K of L" constraint.

4.  **Complexity Framework Primitives (`PPNP.Complexity.Basic`):**
    *   Definitions for `Word`, `Machine`, `P`, `NP`, `PolyTimeReducible`, and `SAT_problem`.
    *   `ShannonEntropyProblem`: An abstract problem for deciding Shannon entropy.
    *   `PhysicsShannonEntropyDecisionProblem`: The problem of deciding if a physics system's generalized Shannon entropy exceeds a threshold, proven to be in `P` via reduction to `ShannonEntropyProblem`. This demonstrates the tractability of calculating the entropic measure relevant to RECT.
    *   Axioms for Shannon's Coding Theorem (SCT), linking source entropy (`H_source_bits`) to the average bits per symbol, and connecting this to the generalized Shannon entropy from physics calculations.

#### 8.3 Detailed Development Roadmap for MVP Completion

The following tasks detail the path to a `sorry`-free MVP. New modules such as `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean` will be created as needed.

**Task 1: Complete Cardinality CNF Constructions in `PPNP.Complexity.Program.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Provide `sorry`-free proofs for the correctness of CNF formulas representing cardinality constraints ("at most K", "at least K", and "exactly K" variables true).
*   **Key Lemmas to Prove (within `CardinalityCNF` namespace):**
    *   `eval_at_most_k_CNF_iff (k : ℕ) (assignment : V → Bool) : (at_most_k_CNF k).eval assignment ↔ Fintype.card { v // assignment v = true } ≤ k`
    *   `eval_at_least_k_CNF_iff (k : ℕ) (assignment : V → Bool) : (at_least_k_CNF k).eval assignment ↔ Fintype.card { v // assignment v = true } ≥ k`
    *   The proof for `eval_exactly_k_CNF_iff` (which combines the above) is already sketched based on these and should become `sorry`-free once its dependencies are proven.
*   **Methodology:** These proofs involve combinatorial arguments about subsets and leveraging properties of CNF evaluation. They are essential for demonstrating that the `SB_Verifier`'s logic is expressible in a standard logical form.

**Task 2: Prove `SB_Verifier_has_CNF_certificate` in `PPNP.Complexity.Program.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Formally prove that `SB_Verifier` possesses a CNF certificate.
*   **Theorem Statement:**
    ```lean
    theorem SB_Verifier_has_CNF_certificate (inst : SB_Instance) :
        HasCNFCertificate (SB_Verifier inst)
    ```
*   **Proof Sketch (as detailed in `COMPLEXITY_README.md` and the file `pkg.txt`):**
    1.  Handle the `inst.M_boxes = 0` case:
        *   If `inst.N_balls = 0`, verifier is `true`. Use `CNF := []`.
        *   If `inst.N_balls > 0`, verifier is `false`. Use `CNF := [[]]`.
    2.  Handle `inst.M_boxes > 0` case:
        *   Let `N_vars_type_idx := num_encoding_vars_for_sb inst`.
        *   Let `K_true_target := num_bars_to_place inst`.
        *   Use `C_sb_cert := CardinalityCNF.exactly_k_CNF (V := Fin N_vars_type_idx) K_true_target` as the witness.
        *   The core of the proof is to show:
            `(SB_Verifier inst assignment_func) ↔ C_sb_cert.eval assignment_func`.
        *   This involves rewriting `C_sb_cert.eval` using `eval_exactly_k_CNF_iff`.
        *   Then, showing the `SB_Verifier`'s internal logic (counting true values in `assignment_func` after `cast`ing its domain due to `num_encoding_vars_for_sb` vs. internal fixed definition) is equivalent to the direct count used by `eval_exactly_k_CNF_iff`. This relies on `Fintype.card_congr` with an `Equiv.cast`.
*   **Status:** The proof structure is laid out; requires completion based on Task 1.

**Task 3: Axiomatic Assertion for Polynomial-Time Verification (`IsInP_ComputerProgram`)**

*   **Objective:** Maintain the axiomatic status of `IsInP_ComputerProgram` for the MVP.
*   **Lean Declaration (in `PPNP.Complexity.Program.lean` or a shared `Axioms.lean`):**
    ```lean
    axiom IsInP_ComputerProgram {num_vars : ℕ} (prog : ComputerProgram num_vars) : Prop
    ```
*   **Theorem `SB_Verifier_is_in_P` (Axiomatic for MVP):**
    ```lean
    theorem SB_Verifier_is_in_P (inst : SB_Instance) :
        IsInP_ComputerProgram (SB_Verifier inst) := sorry -- Axiom for MVP
    ```
    *   **Justification:** The logic of `SB_Verifier` (counting true bits in an assignment of length `L`) is clearly linear in `L`, hence polynomial. A full formal proof from first principles of computation is beyond MVP scope.

**Task 4: Define Formal Predicates for the WPD Argument in `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Create a new file `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean` and define the key propositions for the disproof.
*   **Definitions:**
    ```lean

**Task 6: Prove `Disproof_of_Strong_WaveParticleDuality_for_BE_Statistics` in `PPNP.WPD_Argument.lean`**

*   **Objective:** Combine the established classical computability of BE systems with the definition of the WPD hypothesis to derive a formal contradiction.
*   **Theorem Statement:**
    ```lean
    theorem Disproof_of_Strong_WaveParticleDuality_for_BE_Statistics
        (sys_params : BE_System_Parameters)
        (h_valid_domain : sys_params.K_boxes ≠ 0 ∨ sys_params.N_particles = 0)
        (h_WPD : WaveParticleDuality_Hypothesis sys_params) : -- Assume strong WPD holds
        False := by
      -- From Task 5, we have proven BE systems are classically computable and verified.
      have h_BE_is_computable_verified : ClassicalComputabilityVerified sys_params :=
        BoseEinstein_System_Is_ClassicallyComputable_and_Verified sys_params h_valid_domain

      -- Unfold WaveParticleDuality_Hypothesis.
      -- h_WPD is: ¬ ClassicalComputabilityVerified sys_params
      unfold WaveParticleDuality_Hypothesis at h_WPD

      -- We have ClassicalComputabilityVerified sys_params and ¬ ClassicalComputabilityVerified sys_params.
      -- This is a direct contradiction.
      exact h_WPD h_BE_is_computable_verified
    ```
*   **Status:** This proof is straightforward once `BoseEinstein_System_Is_ClassicallyComputable_and_Verified` is established.

#### 8.4 Linking to Broader Complexity Theory (`PPNP.Complexity.Basic`)

The definitions in `PPNP.Complexity.Basic` (P, NP, SAT, etc.) provide essential context. The disproof of strong WPD for BE statistics hinges on RECT mandating an *efficiently computable* classical model (complexity $\sim \log k$, polynomial), whose outputs are *verifiable* by an efficient process (`SB_Verifier`). This establishes classical explainability without needing to resolve P vs. NP. The WPD argument demonstrates that even if finding paths for more complex quantum phenomena *were* NP-hard (as suggested by the DSE "mystery"), it wouldn't necessarily imply "classical inexplicability" if a polynomial-time verifiable model, guaranteed by RECT-like principles, could be shown to exist for the core statistical outcomes.

The successful completion of these tasks will yield a formally verified argument for the classical computability of Bose-Einstein statistics, challenging the notion of their inherent classical inexplicability and providing a concrete example of how Rota's insights, rigorously formalized, can impact foundational questions in physics.
