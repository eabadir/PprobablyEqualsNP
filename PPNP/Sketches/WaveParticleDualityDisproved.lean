**Theorem (Wave-Particle Duality is a Computational Artifact):**

For any valid physical Bose-Einstein system, there exists a deterministic
`ComputerProgram` that can specify any one of its possible microstates.

### Interpretation and Conclusion

The theorem `wave_particle_duality_is_computational_artifact` formally proves
that for any observable state of a Bose-Einstein system, there exists a
corresponding `ComputerProgram`.

- The "Wave" is the probability distribution `p_UD_fin N M` (or "average position at time t") which is also is the state of MANY (infinite) particles over the entire
  state space of `Nat.multichoose N M` possible outcomes. It represents the
  statistical nature of the ensemble of random walks from an infinite light source which emits IID particles doing their individual stochastic movements.

- The "Particle" is state of the single, definite path contributing (the List Bool) whose binary tape contributes to the overall `ComputerProgram` whose existence is
  guaranteed by RECT. It represents the specific, deterministic path taken in
  a single instance of reality .
