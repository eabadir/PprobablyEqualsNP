**Theorem (Bose-Einstein System Has Equivalent Program):**

This theorem is the formal statement of `BE Statistics ↔ Computability`.

The approach here was done before the EGPT Number Theory rational ParticlePMF was completed so it takes a more mathematically cumbersome approach:
For any Bose-Einstein system defined by `N` states and `M` particles, there
exists a system of `PathProgram`'s that can specify its state at arbitrary time t (sum of M PathProgram's each a  are themeselves an int ℤ ). The
complexity of this program is the smallest integer number of bits required to
encode the system's total information content, which is its Shannon entropy.

Assuming the Bose-Einstein distribution were coded in Lean, the more elegant approach is to equiv the real valued function to a BiasedIIDParticleSource and then directly apply the generalized Rota's Entropy & Computability Theorem (`rect_program_for_dist`). Coding the BE distribution in Lean, and the accompanying alternative proof approach, is an excercise left to the reader.

### Interpretation and Conclusion

The theorem `Wave_Interference_Explained_By_Classical_Particle_Paths` formally proves
that for any observable state of a Bose-Einstein system, there exists a
corresponding `PathProgram`.

- The "Wave" is the probability distribution `p_UD_fin N M` (or "average position at time t") which is also is the state of MANY (infinite) particles over the entire
  state space of `Nat.multichoose N M` possible outcomes. It represents the
  statistical nature of the ensemble of random walks from an infinite light source which emits IID particles doing their individual stochastic movements.

- The "Particle" is state of the single, definite path contributing (the List Bool) whose binary tape contributes to the overall `PathProgram` whose existence is
  guaranteed by RECT. It represents the specific, deterministic path taken in
  a single instance of reality .
