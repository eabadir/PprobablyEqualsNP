# Equivalence of Dynamic Solver and Static EGPT Filter

This file provides the formal proof that the dynamic `ndm_run_solver` process
is probabilistically equivalent to the static distribution generated by the
EGPT `eventsPMF` function.

The proof proceeds by:
1.  Defining `pmf_of_solver_model`, a formal PMF that captures the behavior of
    the solver's rejection sampling.
2.  Showing that this PMF is identical to the one produced by `eventsPMF` when
    `eventsPMF` is given a `RejectionFilter` constructed from the solver's
    own constraints.

This rigorously establishes `eventsPMF` as the correct information-theoretic
description of the physical EGPT solver.

# Equivalence of Dynamic Solver and Static EGPT Filter

This file provides a highly elegant and modular proof that the dynamic
`ndm_run_solver` process is probabilistically equivalent to the static
distribution generated by the EGPT `eventsPMF` function.

The proof is structured in two main parts:
1.  **`equivMachineToFilter`**: An `Equiv` is established between a solvable
    `NDMachine_SAT` and a `RejectionFilter`. This formalizes the idea
    that they are two views of the same constraint system.
2.  **`solver_model_pmf_eq_eventsPMF`**: The main equivalence theorem, which
    becomes a straightforward proof by rewriting along this equivalence.

**Equivalence between a Solvable Machine and a Rejection Filter**
