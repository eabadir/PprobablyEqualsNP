We need classical logic for manipulating propositions in `if then else`
within the ShannonEntropy definition, and potentially for complexity class definitions
if they rely on excluded middle implicitly.

/-- Physical Realization of SAT in a Physical System.
This is a placeholder until the full formalization of the physical systems as combinatorics is complete (see Entropy/Physics/README.MD). As combinatoric problems they are decision problems, as decision problems which display Shannon Entropy (By RET) they are computable. As decision problems they can also be represented in CNF form (i.e. SAT). For now, we rely on the physical motivation of the real world SAT problems which Physics is able to solve "somehow" (usually assumed magic of superposition, irrelevant here) .

/- Apply The fully Lean derived Rota's Entropy Theorem to A Physical System
The the porting into Lean of standard statiscal mechanics physics distributions is in process  (and likewise Rota's formalization of a physical system's as combinatoric problems - see the README in Entropy/Physics). For now, we assume that the entropy function is computable.

NOTE - this next axiom only states that RET (fully derived separately) implies computable physics (Not necessarily in P).

Rota's Entropy Theorem (RET) provides the mathematical foundation for this reduction.
We have axiomatized that the entropy function for physical systems, `H_physical_system`,
satisfies the `IsEntropyFunction` criteria (see `H_physical_system_is_IsEntropyFunction`).
By `RotaTheoremAppliesToPhysicalSystems` (which applies the fully derived `PPNP.Entropy.RET.RotaEntropyTheorem`),
we know that `f H_physical_system n = C * Real.log n`.
This demonstrates that `H_physical_system` is fundamentally "Shannon-like" and that the bedrock of Information Theory is that Shannon Entropy is computable. This Shannon-like structure is what justifies the following axiom: the general problem of
computing or deciding properties of `H_physical_system` for arbitrary physical distributions
(`PhysicalSystemEntropyProblem`) is polynomial-time reducible to the problem of computing
standard Shannon entropy (`ShannonEntropyProblem`).
