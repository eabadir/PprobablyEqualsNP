======================================================================================
This file sketches a portion of the Lean formalized work of the late MIT Professor Gian-Carlo Rota, which I call Rota's Entropy Theorem (RET). RET proves equivalence between discrete Shannon Entropy and *all* the continuous physics entropies. To my knowledge, it has never been formally published or peer-reviewed in this manner ... Lean is incredible in this regard! My sole role has been to formalize it in Lean and provide a proof that is as close to his original intent as possible.

a) Guidance before doing a PR?
Information on the proper way to contribute would be greatly appreciated especially as it relates to library structuring. Given the complexity of the code base to support the proof, the code below is a "Minimum Viable Proof" with all detailed proofs replaced by sorry. It is intended to showcase the structure of the argument and the necessary axiomatic framework as a reference for those giving guidance on how to contribute. The full proof is available in the EGPT codebase ().

b) Why This Form of the Theorem?
The full RET is a bidirectional statement: (1)  Rota's Uniqueness of Entropy (RUE) theorem proves any function H satisfying the axioms must be of the form C * H_shannon, and (2) any function of the form C * H_shannon (for C > 0) must satisfy the axioms.

The MVP provided here, RET_All_Enropy_Is_Scaled_Shannon_Entropy, recaps the second, "transport" direction and is chosen because of the stunning generalizability of the result **ALL ENTROPY, INCLUDING CONTINUOUS ENTROPY, IS SCALED SHANNON ENTROPY**. Both Rota's original proof and the Lean formalization use a truly beautiful logarithmic trapping argument to establish this.

The stunning takeaway is that **any real-valued function** that satisfies these fundamental, intuitive properties must be a scaled version of Shannon entropy. This implies that, from an informational perspective, any such real-valued function can be viewed as originating from an underlying normalized probability distribution. The theorem provides a universal lens through which all well-behaved real-valued functions can be understood as measures of information, bridging the discrete and the continuous and establishing entropy as a foundational concept not just for probability theory, but for all of mathematical analysis.

 NOTE ON `sorry`:
 These are "stubs" or placeholders for complex definitions and theorems that exist in the full EGPT codebase. The names and types here are an exact match in the full code base.

/--
**Theorem (Rota Properties Transport Over Scaling):** If a function `H` satisfies
the properties of an entropy function, then any positive constant multiple of `H`
also satisfies those properties.

This transport also allows us to change the base of the logarithm in the entropy function
without re-writing all the axiom proofs which were more easily
done in nats.
