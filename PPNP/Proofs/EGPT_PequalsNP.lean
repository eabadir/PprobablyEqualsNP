**The EGPT Complexity Class P (`P_EGPT`)**

This definition formalizes the class P within the EGPT framework. A language `L`
is in `P_EGPT` if its membership can be decided by a deterministic, polynomial-time
procedure.

In EGPT, this procedure is the **construction and verification of a proof certificate**.
If an input is a "yes" instance, a constructive proof (`SatisfyingTableau`) must exist.
Crucially, the complexity of this proof must be bounded by a native EGPT polynomial
in the size of the input. The deterministic "algorithm" is the process of building
and checking this certificate, a process whose runtime is tied to the certificate's
(polynomial) size.

This definition intentionally mirrors `NP_EGPT`. The core EGPT thesis is that
the non-deterministic "guess" of a certificate (NP) is replaced by the deterministic
*construction* of the certificate (P), and since the certificate's complexity is
polynomially bounded in both cases, the classes are equivalent.

**Theorem: `L_SAT_Canonical` is in the `P_EGPT` Class.**

This theorem proves that the language of all satisfiable canonical CNF formulas
is a member of our P class. The proof is constructive. For any satisfiable
instance, we can deterministically construct a `SatisfyingTableau` using the
`constructSatisfyingTableau` function. We then prove that the complexity of this
deterministically generated certificate is bounded by the universal `n²` polynomial.

# The Final Theorem: P = NP in the EGPT Framework

This theorem proves that the complexity classes P and NP, as defined within
the EGPT framework, are identical.

The proof is a direct consequence of our foundational definitions. Both `P_EGPT`
and `NP_EGPT` are defined by the same core property: the existence of
a polynomially-bounded, verifiable certificate (`SatisfyingTableau`). The
distinction between a non-deterministic "guess" (NP) and a deterministic
"construction" (P) collapses, because in EGPT, if a solution exists, its
certificate is always deterministically constructible in polynomial time.

Therefore, the sets of languages defining each class are proven to be the same.
