## EGPT Natural Numbers Are A Single Particle Path For A "Fair" Random Walk
##############################################################################
The "natural numbers" in EGPT can be thought of as the unique paths of random walks which return to their baseline (heads = tails) for the first time. For example, the number 1 is a path [1,0], 2 is [1,1,0,0], etc.. We can represent the same path in shorter form by dropping the trailing zeros and then the sum of 1's is the number itself. This is the canonical form of a natural number in EGPT.

## Integers As EGPT ChargedParticlePath: A Single Particle Path, with initial direction ("Charge"), for A "Fair" Random Walk
##############################################################################
Symmetric particle paths could start up or down [1,1,0,0] and [0,0,1,1] return to baseline but our Nat/ParticlePath's limit our ability to indicate this difference. The "integers" in EGPT allow describing  two particles starting from the same position but initially moving in different directions paths resulting in the same return time to baseline. We use a single "charge" sign bit to indicate whether the particle went "up" or "down" first for the first half of the path and then did the opposite in the second. path is positive or negative. For example, for a particle that goes up ("heads") for the first part of the the number 1 is a path [1,1,0], and "down" first is -1 is [0,1,0], 2 is [1,1,1,0,0], and -2 is [0,1,1,0,0]. As with the EGPT Naturals (ParticlePath) we can represent ChargedParticlePath in the same path in shorter form by dropping the trailing zeros and then the sign and sum of 1's is the number itself. This is the canonical form of an integer in EGPT.

-- To establish ChargedParticlePath ≃ ℤ:
-- 1. We have `ParticlePath ≃ ℕ` (via equivParticlePathToNat).
-- 2. We need an equivalence `ℕ × Bool ≃ ℤ`. Mathlib provides `Int.equivNatProdBool : ℤ ≃ ℕ × Bool`. [1]
--    Its inverse is `Int.equivNatProdBool.symm : ℕ × Bool ≃ ℤ`.
-- 3. We construct the equivalence:
--    `ChargedParticlePath = ParticlePath × Bool`
--    `≃ ℕ × Bool` (using `Equiv.prodCongr equivParticlePathToNat (Equiv.refl Bool)`) [3]
--    `≃ ℤ` (using `Int.equivNatProdBool.symm`)

## Rationals as EGPT ParticlePMF: Asymmetric Paths & The Positional Probability of a Single Particle Path Under Constraints (Probabality Mass Function)

############################################################################

 While the Integer's corresponded to symmetric compressed paths, our ChargedParticlePaths, we need a representation for asymmetric paths and that is our ParticlePMF and we simply define it as a List Bool representing the "net" heads or tails. As with the ChargedParticlePaths, the leading sign bit allows for compression to just represent whether the 1's represent heads or tails. For example, a particle that goes up two times in a row ("heads") and then down 1 ("tails") is net positive heads and is written [1,1,1,0]. Likewise "down" two times in a row followed by heads once flips the sign bit to 0 [0,1,1,0]. We note that the first part of this represetnation is a string "p" which is ChargedParticlePath and the second part "q" is an inverted ParticlePath. Thus our ParticlePMF can be expressed as p/q where p is an ℤ and q is a ℕ. Unlike the EGPT Naturals (ParticlePath) and Integers (ChargedParticlePath) the ratio of 1's and 0's is the most compressed form for a single particle BUT, we achieve compression by allowing that all asymmetric paths (reorderings) will end in the same position AND allowing that concatenations of the same underlying path have the same ratio and are therefore equivalent to the shortest cananonical represetnation. This is the canonical form of an Rational in EGPT.

  1.  **Canonical Form:** A rational number is represented by a unique `List Bool`
      of the form `{sign bit} ++ {string of 1s} ++ {string of 0s}`. This
      is the most informationally dense way to encode the parameters (sign, p, q)
      and is a natural extension of `ParticlePath` and `ChargedParticlePath`.

  2.  **Physical Interpretation:** This canonical `List Bool` is not just an
      abstract number. It is the direct recipe for constructing a
      `BiasedIIDParticleSource`. The number of 1s is the `p` parameter,
      and the number of 0s is the `q` parameter.

  3.  **Direct Bijection:** The `toRat` and `fromRat` functions are
      direct transformations (counting and construction), avoiding the
      complexities of intermediate sampling or filtering mechanisms. This makes
      the bijection with Mathlib's `ℚ` clear and provable.

**Partition Theory And "Fractal Compression"**
For all the "detail" of the path we use the ParticlePath which is the "uncompressed" form. The ParticlePMF is the "compressed" form. The ParticlePMF is the sum of all the ParticlePath's that have the same probability distribution. For the advanced mathematician, we note that the ParticlePMF's compression is a "coarser" partition under Parition Theory and the ParticlePath is a "finer" partition. Parition Theory's fractal like recursive proofs of probablistic invariance under equal partitioning allows us to see that the ParticlePMF is scale invariant to the number of particles in the system.

## Beth Numbers And Higher Cardinalities
##############################################################################
EGPT is fundamentally based on Partition Theory which holds that the coarser partitions are the sum of the finer partitions. The hierarchy is not just about increasing cardinality but about re-instantiating the Nat/Rat/Real pattern at higher levels of abstraction.


In standard ZFC set theory (which mathlib follows), the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is the statement that Cardinal.aleph 1 = Cardinal.beth 1 (i.e., ℵ₁ = 2^ℵ₀).
mathlib does not assume the Continuum Hypothesis. It is independent of ZFC.

# The EGPT Number Hierarchy Generator (Corrected & Final)

This file formalizes the "restarting hierarchy" of EGPT number analogues.
The mutual dependency between level definitions is resolved by defining
`Nat_L` via direct recursion, and then defining the other types as
aliases (`abbrev`) of `Nat_L`.

1.  A **Recursive Type Generator**: `Nat_L` is the core recursive
    definition. `Real_L n` is simply an alias for `Nat_L (n+1)`.

2.  A **Generalized Proof**: A single theorem, proven by induction, that
    proves the cardinalities of these generated types match the Beth sequence
    (ℶₙ, ℶₙ, ℶₙ₊₁) for any level `n`.
==================================================================

/--
The EGPT "Natural Number" analogue at level `n`. This is the core of the
recursive hierarchy, defined without mutual dependencies.

- **Base Case (n=0):** The fundamental objects are discrete, countable
  `ParticlePath`s, with cardinality ℵ₀ = ℶ₀.
- **Inductive Step (n+1):** The fundamental objects of the next level are
  functions from the current level's objects to `Bool`. This is equivalent
  to the power set, generating the next Beth number.

This is the power set of the "Naturals" of that level. With our
definition of `Nat_L`, this is simply an alias for `Nat_L (n+1)`.

**Theorem (The EGPT Hierarchy Cardinality):** For any level `n : ℕ`,
the cardinalities of the EGPT number analogues follow the Beth sequence:
- `Nat_L n` has cardinality ℶₙ.
- `Rat_L n` has cardinality ℶₙ.
- `Real_L n` has cardinality ℶₙ₊₁.

## Example Dimensions in EGPT
Per the physical observations of Hawking Radiation and the resultant Holographic Principle we see that mathematical dimensions are lossy compressions (operations on "coarser" partitions) of the underlying particle universe. Nat_L 0 is the finest partition of the particle universe (particles are discrete and countable). Nat_L 1 is the next coarser partition consisting of functions as the new fundamental objects - that is functions at L1 are manipulated in the same way as particles at L0. Etc..
