# EGPT Number Theory: Numbers Are Physics
The core axiom of EGPT is that particles move according to a RandomWalk - as they move forward in time step by step, they make a "coin flip" decision to move up or down such as heads = move up, tails = move down. If each heads/tails outcome is recorded we can use binary string of 1's and 0's to capture their path. In Lean we use List Bool as the fundamental type for this binary recording. When the path is walked the next step is independent of history (except the last state/position) - the next step depends only on the current position and the next coin flip. In probability theory each step on the path is said to be "event" in an independent and identically distributed (IID) process, the path formation is called a "memoryless stochastic process" (aka a Markov Process), and the resultant path is called a Markov Chain (or Random Walk).

In short, to describe particle movement and interactions the core encoding we use is a `List Bool`.
