# Photonic Systems as Computable Programs

This file establishes the core EGPT principle for photonic systems, which are
governed by Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics. It proves that any BE system has an
equivalent `ComputerProgram` whose complexity is determined by the system's
Shannon entropy.

This file replaces older, more complex encodings with a direct application of
the generalized Rota's Entropy & Computability Theorem (`rect_program_for_dist`).

**Theorem (Bose-Einstein System Has Equivalent Program):**

For any Bose-Einstein system defined by `N` states and `M` particles, there
exists a `ComputerProgram` that can specify one of its microstates. The
complexity of this program is the smallest integer number of bits required to
encode the system's total information content, which is its Shannon entropy.

This theorem is the formal statement of `BE Statistics ↔ Computability`.

### Conclusion

The theorem `be_system_has_equivalent_program` provides a direct, sorry-free,
and constructive link from the statistical physics of a photonic system to
the EGPT computational model. It demonstrates that the information required
to specify a physical state is definitionally equivalent to the complexity
of a computer program that encodes it. This is a foundational pillar for
both the `P=NP` and "Wave-Particle Duality is a Computational Artifact"
arguments.
