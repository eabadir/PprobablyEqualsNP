### Section 2: The EGPT-SAT Problem

We define the SAT problem in this combinatorial framework.
-/

/--
The state of a single particle in the SAT model.
Its 'law' is the probability of it being 'true' in the next state.
For the simplest model, we can assume a fair coin flip (p=1, q=1).
-/
structure ParticleState_SAT where
  -- The current boolean value of the particle/variable.
  value : Bool
  -- The law governing its next state transition.
  -- This is a ParticlePMF representing its bias (p, q).

which is encodable as a ParticlePath.

`advance_state` computes the next system state by flipping a biased coin for each particle.
This is one step in the parallel Markov process.

    let next_value := source.stream 0 -- Generate one new boolean value.

### The Verifier (DMachine) and Polynomial Time

/--
A DMachine is a deterministic verifier. It takes a potential solution
(a `PathProgram` as a certificate) and an input, and decides to
accept or reject it.
-/

### A Hierarchy of EGPT Problem Languages

This section defines specific languages (sets of programs) within the EGPT framework. It allows us to formally distinguish between general programs, constraint-based programs, and SAT problems, all grounded in the same `ParticlePath` representation.


**Un-Axiomatizing Constraint Encoding**

Instead of an `equivCNF_to_GNat` axiom we give a constructive
proof. We achieve this by defining a *syntactic* data structure for CNF
formulas, proving it can be bijectively encoded to a `ParticlePath`, and then
providing an interpreter that gives this syntax its semantic meaning within our "balls and boxes" model.

# The Solver-Filter Equivalence Flow

This file demonstrates the direct, constructive link between the dynamic EGPT
solver and the static EGPT probability distribution.

The `ndm_run_solver_produces_filter` function is designed to output a `RejectionFilter`
upon finding a solution. This `RejectionFilter` is precisely the object that
the `eventsPMF` function consumes to generate a probability distribution.

This establishes that the job of the physical solver is to discover the
parameters of the constrained system, which can then be used to describe the
probabilistic behavior of that system.

Calculates the single characteristic rational number of a filter. This represents
the probability that a uniformly random k-bit vector will satisfy the filter's

of the total state space.

**Computes the Canonical EGPT Program for a Set of Physical Laws.**

This function embodies a core thesis of EGPT. It takes a `RejectionFilter`
(representing a set of physical laws and a non-empty solution space) and
constructs the single, canonical `ComputerTape` (a `List Bool`) that
represents the information content of those laws.

The process is a direct, computable chain:
1.  The `RejectionFilter`'s information content is quantified as a single
    rational number by `characteristicRational`.
2.  This rational number `ℚ` is converted into its canonical EGPT representation,
    a `ParticlePMF`, using the `fromRat` bijection.
3.  The underlying `List Bool` of the `ParticlePMF` is, by definition, the
    canonical `ComputerTape` or "program" for that rational.
-/
noncomputable def EGPTProgramForRejectionFilter {k : ℕ} (filter : RejectionFilter k) : ComputerTape :=
  -- 1. Calculate the characteristic rational of the filter.
  let prob_success : ℚ := characteristicRational filter
  -- 2. Convert this rational number into its canonical EGPT representation.
  let egpt_rational : ParticlePMF := fromRat prob_success

# EGPT NP-Completeness and the Cook-Levin Theorem

This file provides the definitive EGPT formalization of NP-Completeness.
The core EGPT thesis is that a problem's complexity is reflected in the
physical structure of its solution space.

- **P-like Problems ("Nat-like"):** Have a simple, symmetric, or dense
  solution space. The `ndm_run_solver` (physical reality) finds a solution
  quickly. Their characteristic rational is simple.

- **NP-Hard Problems ("Rat-like"):** Have a complex, sparse, or irregularly
  constrained solution space. Finding a solution via a random physical walk
  is computationally difficult.

This file defines `NPComplete_EGPT` and proves that the language `L_SAT`
(the set of all satisfiable CNF formulas) is NP-Complete within this
physical framework.
==================================================================
-/



/--
**The Canonical NP-Complete Problem: `L_SAT`**

`L_SAT` is the language of all `SyntacticCNF_EGPT` formulas that are satisfiable.
An instance `cnf` is in the language if there exists *any* assignment that makes
`evalCNF cnf` true.
-/
def L_SAT (k : ℕ) : Lang_EGPT_SAT k :=
  { cnf | ∃ (assignment : Vector Bool k), evalCNF cnf assignment = true }

/--
**A Polynomial-Time EGPT Reducer.**

This class defines what it means for a function `f`, which transforms one
CNF problem into another, to be "polynomial-time" within the EGPT framework.

The EGPT definition of efficiency is based on information content, which is
measured by the length of the `ComputerTape` that encodes a problem. A reduction
`f` is considered efficient (polynomial-time) if the length of its output tape
is bounded by a polynomial function of the length of its input tape.

This definition avoids abstract Turing Machines and instead relies on the
concrete, physical measure of program size.
-/
class IsPolynomialEGPT_Reducer (f : UniversalCNF → UniversalCNF) : Prop where
  is_poly : ∃ (P : EGPT_Polynomial), -- The witness is now a native EGPT_Polynomial
    ∀ (ucnf : UniversalCNF),
      (encodeCNF (f ucnf).2).length ≤ toNat (P.eval (fromNat (encodeCNF ucnf.2).length))

/--
**Instance for the Identity Reducer.**

The identity function (`id`) is a trivial example of a polynomial-time reducer.
This instance serves as a sanity check, demonstrating that the class is
well-defined. The output length is identical to the input length, which is
bounded by the simple polynomial `p(n) = n`.
-/

  is_poly := by
    -- The witness is the native identity polynomial.
    use EGPT_Polynomial.id
    intro ucnf
    -- The goal is: (encodeCNF (f ucnf).2).length ≤ toNat (EGPT_Polynomial.id.eval (fromNat (encodeCNF ucnf.2).length))
    -- For f = id, (f ucnf).2 = ucnf.2
    -- For EGPT_Polynomial.id.eval x = x

    rw [left_inv]
    -- Now it's: (encodeCNF ucnf.2).length ≤ (encodeCNF ucnf.2).length
/--
**Destructor for `L_SAT` membership.**

If we have a proof that `cnf ∈ L_SAT k`, this function uses `Classical.choice`
to extract the satisfying assignment that is guaranteed to exist. This provides a
concrete "witness" to the satisfiability of the CNF.
-/
noncomputable def L_SAT.get_witness {k : ℕ} (cnf : SyntacticCNF_EGPT k) (h_in_lsat : cnf ∈ L_SAT k) :

  -- We use Classical.choose to get the witness and Classical.choose_spec to get the proof

**Computes a Potential Next State via a Memoryless Random Walk.**

This is the core state transition function of the EGPT physical model. It
defines one step of a parallel Markov process. It is "potential" because it
represents the raw physical evolution, before any constraints are applied.

The function is memoryless: the next state candidate depends *only* on the
`current_state` and the `seed` for randomness, not on any prior history.

1.  It converts the input boolean vector (`current_state`) into a vector of
    `ParticleState_SAT`, where each particle is assigned a fundamental, unbiased
    physical law (a fair coin, represented by the EGPT rational `1/1`).
2.  It calls `advance_state`, which performs `k` parallel, independent, and
    identically distributed (IID) "coin flips" to generate the next state.
3.  It returns the resulting boolean vector.

**The EGPT Non-deterministic Machine (`NDTM_A`) Runner.**

This function embodies the EGPT model of non-deterministic computation. It does
not simulate a Turing Machine abstractly; instead, it models computation as a
physical process: a "computation particle" attempting a random walk through a
state space, where its path is constrained by a set of physical laws.

- **The Machine's "Program":** The `constraints` (`SyntacticCNF_EGPT k`) are the
  program. They define the physical laws of the computational universe.
- **Non-determinism:** The `seed` provides the source of randomness for the
  particle's walk. A different seed leads to a different computational path.
  The problem is "accepted" if there *exists* any seed that finds a valid path.
- **Execution:** The machine performs a random walk with rejection sampling.
  At each time step, it generates a potential next state. If the state obeys
  the constraints, the path is extended. If not, the step is rejected, and
  the machine attempts a new random move from its previous state.

The output is `some path` if a valid computational history of `time_limit`
steps is found, and `none` otherwise.

**Constructs the RejectionFilter representing the complete solution space for a
set of physical constraints.**

This function is the definitive, deterministic EGPT solver. It takes a set of
physical laws, encoded as a `SyntacticCNF_EGPT`, and determines the complete
set of all possible states that are consistent with those laws.

Instead of simulating a non-deterministic random walk to find a single witness,
this function performs a direct, deterministic analysis of the entire state space.

- If the set of valid states (satisfying assignments) is non-empty, it
  constructs and returns a `RejectionFilter` that encapsulates this entire
  solution space.
- If no state can satisfy the constraints, it returns `none`, signifying that
  the physical system is impossible.

This function represents a P-solver for an NP-complete problem. The core EGPT
claim is that the time required for a physical, non-deterministic process to
find a *single* solution is polynomially equivalent to the time required for
this function to characterize the *entire* solution space.

### Theorem: Underlying State Evolution is Memoryless (A Markov Process)

This theorem formalizes the observation that the state transition function used by the
`ndm_constrained_path_solver` is Markovian.

Even though the solver carries a full path history (`current_path`), the generation
of the *next candidate state* at each step depends **only on the most recent state**
in that path and the current seed. It has no dependency on `s_{t-1}, s_{t-2}, ...`.

The proof shows that the state generation logic inside the solver's loop is
definitionally equal to a standalone, memoryless function (`potential_next_state`).

### The EGPT Tableau: A Physical Certificate for NP

This file formalizes the EGPT concept of a "self-recording tableau." It defines
a satisfying assignment's certificate not as an abstract object, but as the
physical information (the sum of particle paths) required to navigate the
computational state space and verify that the assignment satisfies every
constraint clause.

**Calculates the EGPT "Path Cost" to verify a single literal.**

In the EGPT model, verifying the `i`-th literal in a `k`-variable system
requires a computational path of complexity `i`. This represents the
information needed to "address" or "focus on" the `i`-th component of the
state vector.

The path is a `ParticlePath` (EGPT Natural Number), making the cost a
direct, physical quantity.
